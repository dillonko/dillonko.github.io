                Hey!<br>Sorry I haven't posted in like 4 days, I've just been really busy.<br><br>I haven't done anything in the past few days, just played games and getting everything set up with the PC. I have been trying to fix an issue where the computer won't turn off - it was due to the WIFI card so I will probably get a TP-Link .<br><br>I am now on my school holidays but it is so boring when there is nothing to do, it's too cold to go out so all I can really do is stay indoors which gets really boring after a week. I also have to revise as i'm doing my GCSE's, so there is very little fun to be had other than to game or watch TV.<br><br>Anyway, i'm going to sleep cause I am really, really tired so I'll try to post tomorrow!

I am really excited!<br><br>If you are interested in the specs of my pc, here they are : i5 7600k CPU<br>GeForce GTX 1060 6gb GPU<br>750W FSP 80+ Silver PSU<br>Gigabyte GA-Z270 Gaming K3 Motherboard<br>Seagate 1TB Firecuda SSHD<br><br>I going to do some random stuff so I'll probably post tomorrow.

If you are interested in the specs, I’ll post them soon.<br><br>I have to go to lunch now so I’ll see you soon!

                Well this is my first post so I better introduce myself. So, my name Josh and I like to make and design websites as a hobby. I will post whenever I can – I’ll try to post every day; I probably won't though! Anyway, another hobby I endorse myself in is photography as I love media and want to improve my cinematography and just to generally get more comfortable with handling cameras. If you are interested in my works - then you can find them in the gallery.
